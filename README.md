## Description

NBTEdit is a plugin which allows the ability to view and modify player NBT tags in a live-environment with a single easy-to-use command.

The theory behind this plugin is that for certain events that may require manual intervention relating to NBT tags, the plugin will allow this with little-hassle to the administrator and removes the requirement for any other plugins or changes.

## Commands

The following commands allow those with permissions to view and edit NBT player data.
The commands are all accessible through the command alias "/nbt"

- **/nbtedit set (player) (tag) (value)**
  - Change the value of a tag for the specified player.
- **/nbtedit view (player) (tag)**
  - View the value of the tag for the specified player.

## Permissions

There is only a single permission required to operate NBTEdit as it is intended as an administration tool.

- **nbtedit.admin**
  - This admin permission allows the user access to all features of the plugin.
